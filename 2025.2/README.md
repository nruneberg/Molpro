We are writing to let you know about the release of  Molpro version 2025.2 containing new features and improvements, summarised at https://www.molpro.net/manual/doku.php?id=recent_changes.  Those who have a current licence for Molpro can obtain it now from https://www.molpro.net/licensee/download .

The graphical user input program iMolpro, which provides a complete platform for using Molpro on Windows, MacOS and Linux, including the running of jobs both locally and on remote servers, is open source and freely available.  It now contains an embedded copy of Molpro which can be used for educational purposes without registering for a licence.  This embedded Molpro has restricted functionality, and its use for research is not permitted. If a full copy of Molpro is found locally, iMolpro uses it instead.  For further details, see https://github.com/molpro/iMolpro/blob/master/README.md;  self-contained binaries for MacOS, Linux and Windows can be downloaded from https://github.com/molpro/iMolpro/releases/latest.

We hope that you enjoy using Molpro, and look forward to any feedback you may have to offer.

Kind regards,
The Molpro Team
